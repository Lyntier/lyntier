### Hello!

I am Lyntier. I make programs. Would you like to check them out?


### DelauNET
##### https://github.com/lyntier/DelauNET
Delaunet is a C# Triangulation library that's not Triangle.NET . After getting frustrated with ports and programs not working, I decided to write my own.

That's all for now; more is on the way!
