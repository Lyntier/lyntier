### Hello!

I am Lyntier. I make programs. Would you like to check them out?

### Slimther

Slimther is the first game I ever published. It's a very simple "move the snake around the obstacle" game, and I learnt how to integrate several Google services into a Unity project with it, such as AdMob and Google Play Games Services. Would you like to give it a try?

### DelauNET

Delaunet is a C# Triangulation library that's not Triangle.NET . After getting frustrated with ports and programs not working, I decided to write my own.

That's all for now; more is on the way!
